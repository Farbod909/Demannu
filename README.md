A few years ago, me and a few others were assigned the menial job of creating a game. 
This game wasn't finished, or named for that matter,
hence the name it currently holds is "unnamed spelled backwards."

Now, in an attempt to learn Pygame, I have started to recreate the game using the
sprites that I created back then.
